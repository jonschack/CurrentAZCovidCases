However, though the data set is updated once per day, no historical data is maintained and recovered cases are either not tracked or not removed from the data set. This makes the ADHS \"COVID-19 Cases by Zip Code\" map not practically useful for measuring current case loads by zip code.\n",

I will then agglomerate and visualize this data such that a resident could easily understand how their zip code is currently affected by COVID-19 and therefore plan their errands accordingly. For the visualizations, both the *pandas* and *geopandas* Python packages will be used."
